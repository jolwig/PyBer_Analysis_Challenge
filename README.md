# PyBer_Analysis_Challenge

## Overview
For this project, I analyised data from a ride sharing app called PyBer. First, I grouped the data by city type (rural, suburban, and urban). Next I calculated the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type using the sum() and count() functions.
After I created the data summary for each city type, I then made a line chart that displays the sum of the fares for each week by city type.

## Results
Based on the city type summary, I found that urban areas have the highest amount of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Rural areas have the lowest. However, rural areas have the highest average fare per driver and the highest average fare per ride. Suburban areas fall in the middle for all five categories.
The line chart you can see the total fare for each city type.

## Conclusion
I think the most notable finding is the ratio of total rides/total drivers is significanly higher in urban areas than in suburban and rural areas. There may be too few drivers in rural and suburban areas, or too many drivers in urban areas. I think the best way to figure this out would be to run an analysis on average time from the moment the ride is ordered to the time of pickup.

If the time from order to pickup is significanly longer in one area than it is in the others, it might be a good idea to create extra incentives to onboard more drivers in the area that is slow.
