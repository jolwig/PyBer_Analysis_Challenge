# PyBer_Analysis_Challenge

##Overview
For this project, I analyised data from a ride sharing app called PyBer. First, I grouped the data by city type (rural, suburban, and urban). Next I calculated the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type using the sum() and count() functions.
After I created the data summary for each city type, I then made a line chart that displays the sum of the fares for each week by city type.

##Results
Based on the city type summary, I found that urban areas have the highest ammount of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Rural areas have the lowest. However, rural areas have the highest average fare per driver and the highest average fare per ride. Suburban areas fall in the middle for all five categories.
The line chart you can see the total fare for each city type.
